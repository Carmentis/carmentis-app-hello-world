# Carmentis Application Example - Hello World (ExpressJS)

This repository contains the "Hello World" application in Carmentis, written using ExpressJS.
We have designed this application as a frictionless tutorial, in which you will discover the following key points:
1. You will learn a typical architecture of an application in the Carmentis workflow.
2. You will learn the minimal configuration required.
3. You will learn what is an "Operator" and what it can do for you.
4. You will learn the major steps in the design and the development of an application.


## Motivation
The goal is to construct a publicly-available messaging board, in which anyone can post a message, later being 
displayed in the public board. Your published message is tied with your wallet and hence, with your (Carmentis) identity. 

## Installation
Before to dive in all the technical details, several parts have to be carefully installed.

### Installing NodeJS and Dependencies
TODO
### Installing Operator Server of Carmentis
TODO

### Installing Wallet of Carmentis
TODO


### Preparing all the necessary pieces of data

## ToDo
